# UI-UX_LP
Code summary of UI/UX Live Project

## Intro
Over the course of two weeks, I worked by myself creating a multitude of logos, mockups, templates, wireframes, and prototypes for different mock clients. Towards the end, I hard-coded one of the mockups (which started out as a style-guide) into a fully functioning site based on 'client' requests and criteria. This project gave me significant insight into the role of a UI/UX Designer, the ability to listen and adapt to a client's needs, as well as the experience of producing various solutions to meet those needs.

## A Pinch of Salt
One of the mock clients I worked with - they were a food and recipe-centric blog in need of a sleek and fresh take on their online persona. For this client, I created multiple new logos through Adobe Photoshop, five varying color palettes including different typefaces, and a more solidified style guide that could be used as a reference for front-end developers later down the line. These can be viewed in the PinchOfSalt folder.

## Prosper Marketing
The second mock client I worked with; This company was known for being a successful, versatile marketing brand. They were looking to update their website to show off their professionalism, but wanted the site to maintain their enthusiastically bright and creative side. To satisfy this, I decided to give them a 50 / 50 split screen layout, with collapsible sections and subtle animation to make the site feel intuitively interactive while being easy to navigate. This company came with a predetermined color palette, but I ended up creating a style guide, new logos, mockups, prototypes, and eventually coded the website. These can all be viewed in the ProsperMarketing folder.
